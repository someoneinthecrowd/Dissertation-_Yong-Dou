\section{Colloid Robots}
Here we give the  automation level definitions for colloids robots,   analogy to the Levels of driving
automation\cite{taeihagh2019governing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Level 0 no automaton:equilibrium  
    \item Level 1 autonomous  motion: individual can continuous change the energy input into motion without any directional information from energy.
    \item Level 2 autonomous coordination: group of colloid robots can interact with each other to perform swarm and patterns 
    \item Level 3  autonomous directed motion(eye on): can guide with the outside computer vision system feedback system 
    \item Level 4  autonomous navigation (eye off): can guide without the outside 
    \item Level 5 share the information with each other and communicate  
    \item Level 6  Fully artificial intelligent with 0 human input after made them（Genesis）
\end{itemize}

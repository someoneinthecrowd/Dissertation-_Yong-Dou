\hspace{10mm}I would like to thank those who contributed and supported through my graduate studies at
Columbia University. First of all I would like to express my sincere appreciation to
my advisor, Professor Kyle J. M. Bishop, for his guidance and support. I am grateful to him for
providing me with the opportunity to work in the research area of colloids and helping me with
great discussions and inspirations. Without his patience and advice, I would not be able to have
achievements in my research work. I would also like to thank the members of my graduate
committee, Professor Oleg Gang, Professor Mijo Simunovic , and Professor Paul Chaikin, and Professor Henry Hess, all of whom have taught me through my graduate studies.
 I thank to my friends who made my life in New York enjoyable and all members of
Bishop Group in the past and present who provide a nice environment in which to work. The
great friendships that I have made with them have given me things to look forwards to outside of
research as well as countless happy memories that I will always be thankful. Finally, I would like
to express deep appreciation to my parents for their infinite support and love.

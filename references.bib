@article{Wang2012,
abstract = {Autonomously moving micro-objects, or micromotors, have attracted the attention of the scientific community over the past decade, but the incompatibility of phoretic motors with solutions of high ionic strength and the use of toxic fuels have limited their applications in biologically relevant media. In this letter we demonstrate that ultrasonic standing waves in the MHz frequency range can levitate, propel, rotate, align, and assemble metallic microrods (2 $\mu$m long and 330 nm diameter) in water as well as in solutions of high ionic strength. Metallic rods levitated to the midpoint plane of a cylindrical cell when the ultrasonic frequency was tuned to create a vertical standing wave. Fast axial motion of metallic microrods at {\~{}}200 $\mu$m/s was observed at the resonant frequency using continuous or pulsed ultrasound. Segmented metal rods (AuRu or AuPt) were propelled unidirectionally with one end (Ru or Pt, respectively) consistently forward. A self-acoustophoresis mechanism based on the shape asymmetry of the metallic rods is proposed to explain this axial propulsion. Metallic rods also aligned and self-assembled into long spinning chains, which in the case of bimetallic rods had a head-to-tail alternating structure. These chains formed ring or streak patterns in the levitation plane. The diameter or distance between streaks was roughly half the wavelength of the ultrasonic excitation. The ultrasonically driven movement of metallic rods was insensitive to the addition of salt to the solution, opening the possibility of driving and controlling metallic micromotors in biologically relevant media using ultrasound.},

abstract = {Active colloids are small scale materials capable of producing enhanced motion within fluid environments. The field of active colloids has grown rapidly over the last ten years and is approaching maturity where viable applications are within reach. In this review, recent advances are surveyed with a strong emphasis on developments that can enable autonomous applications, where colloids execute useful tasks without external interventions. These applications are likely to prove transformative as the resulting technologies will be significantly less complex than current methods. A survey of the requirements to achieve autonomous applications is provided, considering guidance, solution compatibilities, manufacture and function; with reference to recent developments in these capacities. Following on from this, progress towards applications in environmental remediation, lab-on-a-chip microfluidics and in vivo drug delivery is highlighted.},

abstract = {Cell motility in viscous fluids is ubiquitous and affects many biological processes, including reproduction, infection and the marine life ecosystem. Here we review the biophysical and mechanical principles of locomotion at the small scales relevant to cell swimming, tens of micrometers and below. At this scale, inertia is unimportant and the Reynolds number is small. Our emphasis is on the simple physical picture and fundamental flow physics phenomena in this regime. We first give a brief overview of the mechanisms for swimming motility, and of the basic properties of flows at low Reynolds number, paying special attention to aspects most relevant for swimming such as resistance matrices for solid bodies, flow singularities and kinematic requirements for net translation. Then we review classical theoretical work on cell motility, in particular early calculations of swimming kinematics with prescribed stroke and the application of resistive force theory and slender-body theory to flagellar locomotion. After examining the physical means by which flagella are actuated, we outline areas of active research, including hydrodynamic interactions, biological locomotion in complex fluids, the design of small-scale artificial swimmers and the optimization of locomotion strategies.},

@article{Das2015,
abstract = {The advent of autonomous self-propulsion has instigated research towards making colloidal machines that can deliver mechanical work in the form of transport, and other functions such as sensing and cleaning. While much progress has been made in the last 10 years on various mechanisms to generate self-propulsion, the ability to steer self-propelled colloidal devices has so far been much more limited. A critical barrier in increasing the impact of such motors is in directing their motion against the Brownian rotation, which randomizes particle orientations. In this context, here we report directed motion of a specific class of catalytic motors when moving in close proximity to solid surfaces. This is achieved through active quenching of their Brownian rotation by constraining it in a rotational well, caused not by equilibrium, but by hydrodynamic effects. We demonstrate how combining these geometric constraints can be utilized to steer these active colloids along arbitrary trajectories.},

@article{Takagi2014,
abstract = {Self-propelled particles can exhibit surprising non-equilibrium behaviors, and how they interact with obstacles or boundaries remains an important open problem. Here we show that chemically propelled micro-rods can be captured, with little change in their speed, into close orbits around solid spheres resting on or near a horizontal plane. We show that this interaction between sphere and particle is short-range, occurring even for spheres smaller than the particle length, and for a variety of sphere materials. We consider a simple model, based on lubrication theory, of a force- and torque-free swimmer driven by a surface slip (the phoretic propulsion mechanism) and moving near a solid surface. The model demonstrates capture, or movement towards the surface, and yields speeds independent of distance. This study reveals the crucial aspects of activity-driven interactions of self-propelled particles with passive objects, and brings into question the use of colloidal tracers as probes of active matter.},

@article{Palacci2013,
abstract = {Spontaneous formation of colonies of bacteria or flocks of birds are examples of self-organization in active living matter. Here, we demonstrate a form of self-organization from nonequilibrium driving forces in a suspension of synthetic photoactivated colloidal particles. They lead to two-dimensional "living crystals," which form, break, explode, and re-form elsewhere. The dynamic assembly results from a competition between self-propulsion of particles and an attractive interaction induced respectively by osmotic and phoretic effects and activated by light. We measured a transition from normal to giant-number fluctuations. Our experiments are quantitatively described by simple numerical simulations. We show that the existence of the living crystals is intrinsically related to the out-of-equilibrium collisions of the self-propelled particles.},

abstract = {Delivering therapeutics deep into damaged tissue during bleeding is challenging because of the outward flow of blood. When coagulants cannot reach and clot blood at its source, uncontrolled bleeding can occur and increase surgical complications and fatalities. Self-propelling particles have been proposed as a strategy for transporting agents upstream through blood. Many nanoparticle and microparticle systems exhibiting autonomous or collective movement have been developed, but propulsion has not been used successfully in blood or used in vivo to transport therapeutics. We show that simple gas-generating microparticles consisting of carbonate and tranexamic acid traveled through aqueous solutions at velocities of up to 1.5 cm/s and delivered therapeutics millimeters into the vasculature of wounds. The particles transported themselves through a combination of lateral propulsion, buoyant rise, and convection. When loaded with active thrombin, these particles worked effectively as a hemostatic agent and halted severe hemorrhage in multiple animal models of intraoperative and traumatic bleeding. Many medical applications have been suggested for self-propelling particles, and the findings of this study show that the active self-fueled transport of particles can function in vivo to enhance drug delivery.},

abstract = {The application of glancing angle deposition (GLAD) as a means to produce a variety of multifunctional patchy particles is reported. The GLAD technique has been previously used to produce anisotropic particles with an anisotropy dimension of "patchiness". Here, we extend the technique to produce multifunctional patchy particles with anisotropy dimensions of "patchiness", "branching", and "chemical ordering". To access the entire particle surface, a particle stamping technique is employed using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp. The particle stamping technique along with GLAD yields multifunctional patchy particles having patches oil opposite poles. The potential of the developed techniques in producing it wide variety of surface-anisotropic particles with variable patch size, shape. and orientation is demonstrated.},

@article{Perro2005,
abstract = {Because the Roman god Janus was usually represented with two heads placed back to back, the term Janus is used for the description of particles whose surfaces of both hemispheres are different from a chemical point of view. So, they could be used as building blocks for supraparticular assemblies, as dual-functionalized devices, as particular surfactants if one hemisphere is hydrophilic and the other hydrophobic, etc. If they could allow the segregation of negative charges on one hemisphere and positive charges on the other one, they would display a giant dipole moment allowing their remote positioning by rotation in an electric field as a function of field polarity. This review deals with the great and imaginative efforts which were devoted to the synthesis of Janus particles in the last fifteen years. A special emphasis is made on scalable techniques and on those which apply to the preparation of Janus particles in the nanometer range. Specific properties and applications of Janus particles are discussed.},

This system serves as a prototype of controlled dynamic self-assembly with applications to micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS). An experimental system is described and results of several experiments presented. Two theoretical approaches to the analysis of the system are described. A physics-based first-principles model is used to analyze the system in detail. From this, a rules-based model is abstracted from which other self-organizing transportation systems may be designed.},

For an array of globally coupled identical oscillators, repulsive coupling results in a family of synchronized regimes characterized by zero mean field. If the number of oscillators is sufficiently large, phase locking among oscillators is destroyed, independently of the coupling strength, when the oscillators' natural frequencies are not the same. In locally coupled networks, however, phase locking occurs even for nonidentical oscillators when the coupling strength is sufficiently strong.},

abstract = {Microorganisms move in challenging environments by periodic changes in body shape. In contrast, current artificial microrobots cannot actively deform, exhibiting at best passive bending under external fields. Here, by taking advantage of the wireless, scalable and spatiotemporally selective capabilities that light allows, we show that soft microrobots consisting of photoactive liquid-crystal elastomers can be driven by structured monochromatic light to perform sophisticated biomimetic motions. We realize continuum yet selectively addressable artificial microswimmers that generate travelling-wave motions to self-propel without external forces or torques, as well as microrobots capable of versatile locomotion behaviours on demand. Both theoretical predictions and experimental results confirm that multiple gaits, mimicking either symplectic or antiplectic metachrony of ciliate protozoa, can be achieved with single microswimmers. The principle of using structured light can be extended to other applications that require microscale actuation with sophisticated spatiotemporal coordination for advanced microrobotic technologies.},

It has intrigued some of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century, including Albert Einstein, Richard Feynman, Norbert Wiener, Brian Josephson, and Arthur Winfree. At once elegant and riveting, Sync tells the story of the dawn of a new science. Steven Strogatz, a leading mathematician in the fields of chaos and complexity theory, explains how enormous systems can synchronize themselves, from the electrons in a superconductor to the pacemaker cells in our hearts. He shows that although these phenomena might seem unrelated on the surface, at a deeper level there is a connection, forged by the unifying power of mathematics."--Pub. desc.

Using a fast video camera, we measured the acceleration of the bead and the period of its motion as a function of the applied voltage. A mathematical model based on the hypothesis of electrostatic equilibrium is proposed to describe the dynamics of the system. We observe a stabilization of the trajectories: A bead bouncing between two electrodes tends to oscillate on a quasivertical trajectory, whatever its initial horizontal velocity. When two identical beads are placed together in a capacitor, they oscillate at the same frequency and an antiphase synchronization effect occurs. We propose a simple mechanism based on a Kuramoto-like model to explain it.},

This robot is quadrupedal; it uses no sensors, only five actuators, and a simple pneumatic valving system that operates at low pressures ({\textless} 10 psi). A combination of crawling and undulation gaits allowed this robot to navigate a difficult obstacle. This demonstration illustrates an advantage of soft robotics: They are systems in which simple types of actuation produce complex motion.},

Motivated by this experimental system, we study repulsively coupled Kuramoto oscillators with nearest-neighbor interactions, on a linear chain as well as a ring in one dimension, and on a triangular lattice in two dimensions. In one dimension, we show using linear stability analysis as well as numerical study that the stable phase patterns depend on the geometry of the lattice. We show that a transition to the ordered state does not exist in the thermodynamic limit. In two dimensions, we show that the geometry of the lattice constrains the phase difference between two neighboring oscillators to 2$\pi$/3. We report the existence of domains with either clockwise or anticlockwise helicity, leading to defects in the lattice. We study the time dependence of these domains and show that at large coupling strengths the domains freeze due to frequency synchronization. Signatures of the above phenomena can be seen in the spatial correlation functions.},

@article{Im2011b,
abstract = {Electrophoretic motion of a charged droplet in a dielectric fluid under an electric field has been investigated experimentally for use as a microdroplet actuation method. The effects of the droplet size, electric field strength, and electrolyte concentration and ion species on the charging of an aqueous droplet have been examined. The amount of electrical charging has been measured by two different methods: indirect measurement using the image analysis of droplet motion and direct measurement using the electrometer. Quantitative comparison of the droplet charge measured experimentally and the theoretical value of a perfectly conductive sphere shows that an aqueous droplet is less charged than the corresponding perfectly conductive sphere. The limiting effect on electrical charging is more significant for an electrolyte droplet, and the effect is positively correlated to the electrolyte concentration rather than the ion species. This implies that the low electrical conductivity of water is not a major cause of the limiting effect. The scaling law of the charging amount for a deionized water droplet nearly follows that of the perfect conductor, whereas for an electrolyte droplet, the scaling law exponent is slightly higher. Some advantages and potentials of the current droplet actuation method are also discussed in comparison with the conventional ones.},

abstract = {The realization of nanoscale machines requires efficient methods by which to rectify unbiased perturbations to perform useful functions in the presence of significant thermal noise. The performance of such Brownian motors often depends sensitively on their operating conditionsâin particular, on the relative rates of diffusive and deterministic motions. In this letter, we present a type of Brownian motor that uses contact charge electrophoresis of a colloidal particle within a ratcheted channel to achieve directed transport or perform useful work against an applied load.We analyze the stochastic dynamics of this model ratchet to show that it functions under any operating conditionâ even in the limit of strong thermal noise and in contrast to existing ratchets. The theoretical results presented here suggest that ratcheted electrophoresis could provide a basis for electrochemically powered, nanoscale machines capable of transport and actuation of nanoscale components.},

@article{Ristenpart2009,
abstract = {Electric fields induce motion in many fluid systems, including polymer melts(1), surfactant micelles(2) and colloidal suspensions(3). Likewise, electric fields can be used to move liquid drops(4). Electrically induced droplet motion manifests itself in processes as diverse as storm cloud formation(5), commercial ink-jet printing(6), petroleum and vegetable oil dehydration(7), electrospray ionization for use in mass spectrometry(8), electrowetting(9) and lab-on-a-chip manipulations(10). An important issue in practical applications is the tendency for adjacent drops to coalesce, and oppositely charged drops have long been assumed to experience an attractive force that favours their coalescence(11-13). Here we report the existence of a critical field strength above which oppositely charged drops do not coalesce. We observe that appropriately positioned and oppositely charged drops migrate towards one another in an applied electric field; but whereas the drops coalesce as expected at low field strengths, they are repelled from one another after contact at higher field strengths. Qualitatively, the drops appear to 'bounce' off one another. We directly image the transient formation of a meniscus bridge between the bouncing drops, and propose that this temporary bridge is unstable with respect to capillary pressure when it forms in an electric field exceeding a critical strength. The observation of oppositely charged drops bouncing rather than coalescing in strong electric fields should affect our understanding of any process involving charged liquid drops, including de-emulsification, electrospray ionization and atmospheric conduction.},

@article{Jung2008,
abstract = {It has been conceived that a charged droplet driven by Coulombic force can be used as a droplet-based microreactor. As a basic research for such applications, electrical charging of a conducting water droplet is studied experimentally. The effects of electric field, medium viscosity, and droplet size are investigated. It is found that the amount of electrical charging increases with the droplet size and the electric field. However, the medium viscosity does not have a significant effect in the range of the present study. A scaling law is derived from the experimental results. Unlike the case of a perfect conductor, the estimated amount of electrical charge ( Q est ) of a water droplet is proportional to the 1.59 power of the droplet radius (R) and the 1.33 power of the electric field strength (E). (For a spherical perfect conductor, Q is proportional to R 2 and E.) In order to understand these differences, numerical simulations are performed for the idealized droplets of perfect conductor. Comparison of the numerical and experimental results suggests that the differences are mainly due to incomplete charging of a water droplet resulted from the combined effect of electrochemical reaction at electrode and the relatively low conductivity of water.},

Such a droplet exhibits repetitive translational motion between the electrodes in a spontaneous manner. The state diagram of this oscillatory motion was deduced; at 0-20 V the droplet is fixed at the surface of the electrode, at 20-70 V the droplet exhibits small-amplitude oscillatory motion between the electrodes, and at 70-100 V the droplet shows large-amplitude periodic motion between the electrodes. The observed rhythmic motion is explained in a semiquantitative manner by using differential equations, which includes the effect of charging the droplet under an electric field. We also found that twin droplets exhibit synchronized rhythmic motion between the electrodes.},

Here, we describe a class of systems in which aerobic bacteria Bacillus subtilis moving randomly in a fluid film power submillimeter gears and primitive systems of gears decorated with asymmetric teeth. The directional rotation is observed only in the regime of collective bacterial swimming and the gears' angular velocities depend on and can be controlled by the amount of oxygen available to the bacteria. The ability to harness and control the power of collective motions appears an important requirement for further development of mechanical systems driven by microorganisms.},

abstract = {We present a case study of how topology can affect synchronization. Specifically, we consider arrays of phase oscillators coupled in a ring or a chain topology. Each ring is perfectly matched to a chain with the same initial conditions and the same random natural frequencies. The only difference is their boundary conditions: periodic for a ring, and open for a chain. For both topologies, stable phase-locked states exist if and only if the spread or "width" of the natural frequencies is smaller than a critical value called the locking threshold (which depends on the boundary conditions and the particular realization of the frequencies). The central question is whether a ring synchronizes more readily than a chain. We show that it usually does, but not always. Rigorous bounds are derived for the ratio between the locking thresholds of a ring and its matched chain, for a variant of the Kuramoto model that also includes a wider family of models.},

abstract = {Microorganisms move in challenging environments by periodic changes in body shape. In contrast, current artificial microrobots cannot actively deform, exhibiting at best passive bending under external fields. Here, by taking advantage of the wireless, scalable and spatiotemporally selective capabilities that light allows, we show that soft microrobots consisting of photoactive liquid-crystal elastomers can be driven by structured monochromatic light to perform sophisticated biomimetic motions. We realize continuum yet selectively addressable artificial microswimmers that generate travelling-wave motions to self-propel without external forces or torques, as well as microrobots capable of versatile locomotion behaviours on demand. Both theoretical predictions and experimental results confirm that multiple gaits, mimicking either symplectic or antiplectic metachrony of ciliate protozoa, can be achieved with single microswimmers. The principle of using structured light can be extended to other applications that require microscale actuation with sophisticated spatiotemporal coordination for advanced microrobotic technologies.},

By patterning dissociated rat cardiomyocytes on an elastomeric body enclosing a microfabricated gold skeleton, we replicated fish morphology at 1 10= scale and captured basic fin deflection patterns of batoid fish. Optogenetics allows for phototactic guidance, steering, and turning maneuvers. Optical stimulation induced sequential muscle activation via serpentine- patterned muscle circuits, leading to coordinated undulatory swimming. The speed and direction of the ray was controlled by modulating light frequency and by independently eliciting right and left fins, allowing the biohybrid machine to maneuver through an obstacle course.},

abstract = {Oscillating materials1, 2, 3, 4 that adapt their shapes in response to external stimuli are of interest for emerging applications in medicine and robotics. For example, liquid-crystal networks can be programmed to undergo stimulus-induced deformations in various geometries, including in response to light5, 6. Azobenzene molecules are often incorporated into liquid-crystal polymer films to make them photoresponsive7, 8, 9, 10, 11; however, in most cases only the bending responses of these films have been studied, and relaxation after photo-isomerization is rather slow. Modifying the core or adding substituents to the azobenzene moiety can lead to marked changes in photophysical and photochemical properties12, 13, 14, 15, providing an opportunity to circumvent the use of a complex set-up that involves multiple light sources, lenses or mirrors. Here, by incorporating azobenzene derivatives with fast cis-to-trans thermal relaxation into liquid-crystal networks, we generate photoactive polymer films that exhibit continuous, directional, macroscopic mechanical waves under constant light illumination, with a feedback loop that is driven by self-shadowing. We explain the mechanism of wave generation using a theoretical model and numerical simulations, which show good qualitative agreement with our experiments. We also demonstrate the potential application of our photoactive films in light-driven locomotion and self-cleaning surfaces, and anticipate further applications in fields such as photomechanical energy harvesting and miniaturized transport.},

By controlling a small external magnetic field applied parallel to the interface, we show that asters can capture, transport, and position target microparticles.

We perform transport measurements that provide evidence for a coupling between the centre-of-mass motion of the C60 molecules and single-electron hopping18âa conduction mechanism that has not been observed previously in quantum dot studies. The coupling is manifest as quantized nano-mechanical oscillations of the C60 molecule against the gold surface, with a frequency of about 1.2 THz. This value is in good agreement with a simple theoretical estimate based on van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between C60 molecules and gold electrodes.},

This coupling provides a route for chemical-to-mechanical energy transduction, which enables materials to exhibit self-sustained oscillations and/or waves in both concentration and deformation fields. We focus on synthetic polymer gels, where the chemo-mechanical behavior can be engineered into the material. We provide a brief review of experimental observations on several types of chemo-mechanical oscillations in gels. Then, we discuss methods used to theoretically and computationally model self-oscillating polymer gels. The rest of the paper is devoted to describing results of theoretical and computational modeling of gels that undergo the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction. We discuss a remarkable form of mechano-chemical transduction in these materials, where the application of an applied force or mechanical contact can drive the system to switch between different dynamical behavior, or alter the mechanical properties of the material. Finally, we discuss ways in which photosensitive BZ gels could be used to fabricate biomimetic self-propelled objects. In particular, we describe how non-uniform illumination can be used to direct the movement of BZ gel 'worms' along complex paths, guiding them to bend, reorient and turn.},

abstract = {Synchronization occurs widely in the natural and technological worlds, from the rhythm of applause and neuron firing to the quantum mechanics of coupled Josephson junctions, but has not been used to produce new spatial structures. Our understanding of self-assembly has evolved independently in the fields of chemistry and materials, and with a few notable exceptions has focused on equilibrium rather than dynamical systems. Here we combine these two phenomena to create synchronization-selected microtubes of Janus colloids, micron-sized spherical particles with different surface chemistry on their opposing hemispheres, which we study using imaging and computer simulation. A thin nickel film coats one hemisphere of each silica particle to generate a discoid magnetic symmetry, such that in a precessing magnetic field its dynamics retain crucial phase freedom. Synchronizing their motion, these Janus spheres self-organize into micrometre-scale tubes in which the constituent particles rotate and oscillate continuously. In addition, the microtube must be tidally locked to the particles, that is, the particles must maintain their orientation within the rotating microtube. This requirement leads to a synchronization-induced structural transition that offers various applications based on the potential to form, disintegrate and fine-tune self-assembled in-motion structures in situ. Furthermore, it offers a generalizable method of controlling structure using dynamic synchronization criteria rather than static energy minimization, and of designing new field-driven microscale devices in which components do not slavishly follow the external field.},

abstract = {Condensation of objects into stable clusters occurs naturally in equilibrium and driven systems. It is commonly held that potential interactions, depletion forces, or sensing are the only mechanisms which can create long-lived compact structures. Here we show that persistent motile structures can form spontaneously from hydrodynamic interactions alone with no sensing or potential interactions. We study this structure formation in a system of colloidal rollers suspended and translating above a floor, using both experiments and large-scale 3D simulations. In this system, clusters originate from a previously unreported fingering instability, where fingers pinch off from an unstable front to form autonomous "critters", whose size is selected by the height of the particles above the floor. These critters are a stable state of the system, move much faster than individual particles, and quickly respond to a changing drive. With speed and direction set by a rotating magnetic field, these active structures offer interesting possibilities for guided transport, flow generation, and mixing at the microscale.},

abstract = {Self-assembled materials must actively consume energy and remain out of equilibrium to support structural complexity and functional diversity. Here we show that a magnetic colloidal suspension confined at the interface between two immiscible liquids and energized by an alternating magnetic field dynamically self-assembles into localized asters and arrays of asters, which exhibit locomotion and shape change. By controlling a small external magnetic field applied parallel to the interface, we show that asters can capture, transport, and position target microparticles. The ability to manipulate colloidal structures is crucial for the further development of self-assembled microrobots.},

abstract = {Pull-in instability as an inherently nonlinear and crucial effect continues to become increasingly important for the design of electrostatic MEMS and NEMS devices and ever more interesting scientifically. This review reports not only the overview of the pull-in phenomenon in electrostatically actuated MEMS and NEMS devices, but also the physical principles that have enabled fundamental insights into the pull-in instability as well as pull-in induced failures. Pull-in governing equations and conditions to characterize and predict the static, dynamic and resonant pull-in behaviors are summarized. Specifically, we have described and discussed on various state-of-the-art approaches for extending the travel range, controlling the pull-in instability and further enhancing the performance of MEMS and NEMS devices with electrostatic actuation and sensing. A number of recent activities and achievements methods for control of torsional electrostatic micromirrors are introduced. The on-going development in pull-in applications that are being used to develop a fundamental understanding of pull-in instability from negative to positive influences is included and highlighted. Future research trends and challenges are further outlined. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We introduce numerical methods for simulating the diffusive motion of rigid bodies of arbitrary shape immersed in a viscous fluid. We parameterize the orientation of the bodies using normalized quaternions, which are numerically robust, space efficient, and easy to accumulate. We construct a system of overdamped Langevin equations in the quaternion representation that accounts for hydrodynamic effects, preserves the unit-norm constraint on the quaternion, and is time reversible with respect to the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution at equilibrium. We introduce two schemes for temporal integration of the overdamped Langevin equations of motion, one based on the Fixman midpoint method and the other based on a random finite difference approach, both of which ensure that the correct stochastic drift term is captured in a computationally efficient way. We study several examples of rigid colloidal particles diffusing near a no-slip boundary and demonstrate the importance of the choice of tracking point on the measured translational mean square displacement (MSD). We examine the average short-time as well as the long-time quasi-two-dimensional diffusion coefficient of a rigid particle sedimented near a bottom wall due to gravity. For several particle shapes, we find a choice of tracking point that makes the MSD essentially linear with time, allowing us to estimate the long-time diffusion coefficient efficiently using a Monte Carlo method. However, in general, such a special choice of tracking point does not exist, and numerical techniques for simulating long trajectories, such as the ones we introduce here, are necessary to study diffusion on long time scales.},

abstract = {Swimming strategies of microorganisms must conform to the principles of self-propulsion at low Reynolds numbers. Here we relate the translational and rotational speeds to the surface motions of a swimmer and, for spheres, make evident novel constraints on mechanisms for propulsion. The results are applied to a cyanobacterium, an organism whose motile mechanism is unknown, by considering incompressible streaming of the cell surface and oscillatory, tangential surface deformations. Finally, swimming efficiency using tangential motions is related to the surface velocities and a bound on the efficiency is obtained.},

abstract = {Condensation of objects into stable clusters occurs naturally in equilibrium and driven systems. It is commonly held that potential interactions, depletion forces, or sensing are the only mechanisms which can create long-lived compact structures. Here we show that persistent motile structures can form spontaneously from hydrodynamic interactions alone with no sensing or potential interactions. We study this structure formation in a system of colloidal rollers suspended and translating above a floor, using both experiments and large-scale 3D simulations. In this system, clusters originate from a previously unreported fingering instability, where fingers pinch off from an unstable front to form autonomous "critters", whose size is selected by the height of the particles above the floor. These critters are a stable state of the system, move much faster than individual particles, and quickly respond to a changing drive. With speed and direction set by a rotating magnetic field, these active structures offer interesting possibilities for guided transport, flow generation, and mixing at the microscale.},

abstract = {Motility is a basic feature of living microorganisms, and how it works is often determined by environmental cues. Recent efforts have focused on developing artificial systems that can mimic microorganisms, in particular their self-propulsion. We report on the design and characterization of synthetic self-propelled particles that migrate upstream, known as positive rheotaxis. This phenomenon results from a purely physical mechanism involving the interplay between the polarity of the particles and their alignment by a viscous torque. We show quantitative agreement between experimental data and a simple model of an overdamped Brownian pendulum. The model notably predicts the existence of a stagnation point in a diverging flow. We take advantage of this property to demonstrate that our active particles can sense and predictably organize in an imposed flow. Our colloidal system represents an important step toward the realization of biomimetic microsystems with the ability to sense and respond to environmental changes.},
